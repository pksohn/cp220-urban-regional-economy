## Storper, Keys to the City - Chapter 5 - Cities and Individuals

Urban resurgence in "old and cold" places like Boston is said to be related to choices of the
"creative class" to choose these places; "resurgence is thus represented as preference driven" (p. 70).
To the contrary, Storper argues that:

> The key to why both ["old and cold" and new and sprawled suburban environments] can flourish, under the right circumstances,
is not their appearance or built form, nor their superficial sociological characteristics, but their economic bases.

### Diversity

Richard Florida and others argue that the creative class prefers and therefore moves to places that are more diverse and tolerent.
Storper suggests that diversity may also be viewed positively because of economic benefits in terms of increased market diversity (ethnic stores),
larger consumer bases (childless gay populations), or more cheap labor. Bigger cities are better positioned to offer all of these.

*Tolerance* depends on each group's ability to manage the costs and benefits of diversity, and may actually be a function of segregation.
It is more likely to arise from economic development than to be a cause; places with racist policies are less likely to get away with them 
in an integrated economy (see North carolina this year). This leaves us here:

> Tolerance, like diversity, is a necessary but not sufficient condition for urban or regional growth. It is unlikely to generate resugence, although
its absence...may well prevent it.

### Density and Beauty

The actual amenities that are available in cities don't vary all that much; there are restaurants, museums, etc no matter if it's NYC or Atlanta.
Storper suggests that *access* to these amenities might be a more promising explanation of urban resurgence. Those that prefer access through
walking have their options, and those that prefer to drive have their options.

Some suggest that *urban beauty* is another factor in resurgence, particularly as it relates to older cities.
It's unlikely that a business would choose to move somewhere because of its physical beauty (see Silicon Valley),
though individuals have intraregional choices that may be swayed by this. Why is oldness valuable as of late? 
Explanations may relate to the decline of manufacturing (pollution, freed up space). 

This trend, however, also mirrors a trend toward similarity betweens cities and suburbs and between regions. 
Dense regions have become more suburbanized while sprawling cities have developed dense suburbs. 
Thus it's really only at the intra-regional scale that we should consider the built environment as a significant factor in resurgence.

### Choices in Cities Do Not Reveal Our Preferences

For many reasons, land does not work like other markets:

* It can't be moved, it's not divisable
* Fixed supply
* Amenities come in bundles
* People are very invested in homes and difficult to move 

# Lecture Notes

Reactions to Saxenian reading:

* She argues that 'brain drain' can be thought of differently, in terms of 'brain circulation'; highly educated immigrants 
generate economic growth and often bring firm development or job growth back to native country.
* Maybe the process Saxenian describes understates the core-periphery dynamic in which many of the sending countries
remain economically dependent on the receiving country. Is she cherry-picking positive cases (Taiwan and India) while 
ignoring cases that don't prove her point?

## Some concepts

* **Human capital**: Level of capability embodied in an individual. Includes things like 
    skills and experience, health/wellbeing, knowledge and educational attainment, 
    "innate potential", productivity, soft skills. Education typically used as a proxy indicator of 
    many of these.
* **Skill**: Economists typically think about skill not in terms of people but in terms of jobs, i.e. 
    the demands of the occupation. But obviously you could argue that people shape jobs: someone can take a job
    and use their experience to carry out that role in a certain way. Two important dimensions of jobs:
    * Substantive complexity
    * Autonomy/control
* **Learning**: Traditional conception is of learning as a distinct process with formal boundaries related to 
    formal education, with expertise being transmitted by experts. More contemporary ideas involve social learning and
    learning outside of formal education, experiential learning. Relevant to planning because of the potential to create
    urban environments that support learning.

Reactions to Florida:

* Causal model based on path analysis
* Defines human capital based on educational attainment (college degree)
* Talks about places as metropolitan areas
* Defines diversity as coupled gay households, but this measure is probably more about tolerance

Reactions to Storper:

* Returns to point that economy is the causal driver; tolerance is generated by economic activity
* See Glaeser critique. This and other attempts to replicate this model have found that human capital (education) 
is related to growth, but that other factors are spurious.
* This is important because of how influential Florida's ideas have been; the idea that if you can attract
talent using x, y, and z, you'll be economically vibrant.
