# Reading notes

## Storper, Keys to the City, Chapter 6: Winner and Loser Regions

Some possible sources of specialization:

* **Human Capital**: selection and skilling
* **Accidents**: regional innovators in the right place, right time: capture new activities: first movers win, others lose
* **Institutions**: favorable to capture and retention of activities

Possible sources of regional institutions:

* De facto changes in political behavior: activation/deactivation of communities and elites
* Formal structure of political decision making: heterogeneity of preferences/coordination costs
* Specialization: influence of sectors on institutions
* Human capital, immigration: preferences, mobilization

# Lecture notes (Pedro Peterson)

Cluster Theory (Porter): firms located in clusters are more competitive and regions with large numbers of clusters are more prosperous
* Mostly advanced tech but also agriculture
* Popular but also popular to criticize (Motoyama)

Industrial Districts
* Based on experience of "Third Italy" (Emilia-Romagna), where they managed to create a system of flexible specialization. 
* Seen as a better model for North America, see Schmitz on "collective efficiency".

Cluster theory as development policy
* "New industrial policy" as response to weak growth from neoliberal reforms, decentralized approach in response to failure of investment in large factories.
* In Brazil:
    * IDB launched industrial district development project with SEBRAE and PROMOS
    * Early 2000s - federal government launched "Local Production Arrangements" policy (APL)

APL policies included:
* Access to credit
* Workforce training programs for clusters
* Entrepreneurial training
* Sponsorship of trade fairs
* Investments in infrastructure

Productivity challenges vs. supply chain challenges
* Link between buyers and sellers is straightforward even across different scales
* Market/commercial decisiosn rarely made based on state subsidies
* Productive challenges likely to require more systemic interventions

Linhares able to succeed in furniture industry despite huge challenges (loss of raw materials, not huge labor pool, large transport costs)

Chain governance: specialize in a part of the production process (one firm produce one piece in the bedroom set)
Territorial governance
