## Storper, Keys to the City, Chapter 6: Winner and Loser Regions

Some possible sources of specialization:

* **Human Capital**: selection and skilling
* **Accidents**: regional innovators in the right place, right time: capture new activities: first movers win, others lose
* **Institutions**: favorable to capture and retention of activities

Possible sources of regional institutions:

* De facto changes in political behavior: activation/deactivation of communities and elites
* Formal structure of political decision making: heterogeneity of preferences/coordination costs
* Specialization: influence of sectors on institutions
* Human capital, immigration: preferences, mobilization
