Incentive Competition

# Lecture Notes

Markusen and Nesse; why is incentive competition on the rise?

* Site location consulting industry
* Globalization
* Political devolution/decentralization of government

Conclusion is that the incentive game is a net loser, but depends in specific instances
by terms of the deal and other factors. Yet more evidence against an export-oriented 
outlook on economic development. In general, firms don't tend to move (only 10% move in their lifetime),
and so you can't rely on footloose firms for your development.

## Fiscalization of Land Use

Cities are fiscally constrained today; they now have to rely more on property and sales revenue than in the past. 
There's typically no income tax. One tool they have is to use regulation over land to make sure they are making
property and sales tax revenue. This reliance on property and sales tax revenue often leads to sprawl because:

* Single family homes bring in more wealthy residents
* New infrastructure gets built by developers
* Multifamily is slightly more expensive to cities

Cities are also vulnerable to recessions
