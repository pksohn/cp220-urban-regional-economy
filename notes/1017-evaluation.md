Evaluation

# Lecture Notes

Big picture: values and measurement

Approaches to Evaluation

* Level of impact-rings
* From formative to summative (Bartik)
* 1st order vs 2nd order

Technical issues

* Validity: "but for" question; would this have happened but for the project/policy? 
    Would impacts have occurred despite the project not happening?  
* Selection bias: Are you cherry picking results? Need to control for effects.
* Zero-sum game: Growth may simply be reshuffled (somewhere else is losing jobs for your gain). 
    But this could have positive overall benefits (transportation effects, housing effects). 
    If Uber is moving closer to a disadvantaged population, there could be social benefit 
    (move from area of overabundance to area of underabundance).
* Cost-benefit

## Bartik and Bingham: Can Economic Development Programs Be Evaluated?

A scale from **Process/Formative** evaluation to **Outcome/Summative** evaluation:

* Daily tasks
* Program activities
* Outcomes
* Effectiveness
* Costs/benefit: difficulty of parsing out cost and benefit to different stakeholders, opportunity costs
* Impact

Job chains: do they generate positive economic development outcomes? 
Uber creates 100 developer jobs; bring people in from other places that are already in technical fields, highly skilled individuals. 
What about jobs they leave behind? Other people, perhaps less skilled, take the jobs left behind.
The idea is that at the end of the chain, you start to tap the unemployed pool. 
But you won't ever dig down into the disadvantaged, chronically unemployed section of the population.

## Different scales
Consider a redevelopment project to build a large office. (Say, Uber moving into Oakland). Several levels of impact:

* *Internal to the firm*: Shorter commutes for East Bay employees. 
* *Direct project impact*: Increase in housing prices, decrease in vacancies in housing market, 
    possibly spur new construction, possible displacement, transportation impacts, effect on small business, 
    on the business environment, on city schools
* *Societal/community impact*: Change in reputation of the city
