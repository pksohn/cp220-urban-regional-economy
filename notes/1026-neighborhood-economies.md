# Lecture Notes

Most strategies target a geographic area, social community, or economically defined population (e.g. disadvantaged).
Efforts tend to be comprehensive; most of efforts were focused on housing 30-40 years ago but broadened to offer
job training and other services.

But how do we do this? Conflicting theories:

* **Porter**: Markets need to be allowed to take their effect in inner-city neighborhoods and take advantage of their 
competitive advantage. These neighborhoods tend to have advantages including location (transportation), untapped
local market, human resources, integration to regional clusters. Lots of pushback on these ideas:
    * Ahistoric - ignores the history of urban renewal, discrimination, white flight that have made inner cities
    the way they are.
    * Lack of attention to structural conditions of inner city workforce
    * Focus on bringing businesses in from outside
    * Idea that CBOs don't work enough like businesses and need to step out of the way
* **Teitz**: Onus is on the community to mobilize and be part of growth coalition, but at the same time, hard to 
successfully develop on the neighborhood level.

Solutions? **Giloth** suggest connecting community groups to anchor institutions. Taking advantage
of large hospitals, local purchasing agreements. Supporter of different types of asset building plans through banking,
building home equity, etc. This is an underutilized method of doing community economic development. Social economy 
programs, social entrepreneurship, double-bottom-line type programs.
