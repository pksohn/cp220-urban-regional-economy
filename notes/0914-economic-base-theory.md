## North vs. Tiebout

Both scholars use a region's export base to explain economic growth and development to varying degrees. 

North first refutes the "traditional" notion of regional economic growth, whereby an economy slowly matures through the stages of growth, from primary to secondary to tertiary. He then argues that the (long-term in particular) success of the export base, aided by various locational production factors, is *the* determining factor in a region's growth (using lumber in the Pacific Northwest as an example). It determines the extent of the residentiary activity supporting this primary industry, and also regional incomes, population growth and urbanization patterns, etc. He acknowledges that this export base does not need to be industrial in nature; an agricultural export base can also yield desirable residentiary outcomes.

On the other hand, Tiebout contends that there are other external factors at play in assessing regional growth. Especially for larger regions, essentially what is an export vs. an import becomes murkier, and other endogenous factors enter the picture too: "dynamic forces causing income change ... found inside its borders." Also, with internal trade within the larger regions, the relative importance of exports may decrease. Lastly, he brings up two exogenous factors that can be important determinants of a given export base: the success and prosperity of nearby regions that would be on the importing end of the export goods, and factor costs, which may vary largely from region to region. 

## Katz and Bradley

Onto Katz and Bradley. They basically championed the role of cities and regions, coming together to form a network of regional economies that defines the national economy, sort of ringing back to Jacobs' thesis. The key here is the focus on producing innovation and exporting it--it replicates horizontally across cities and also scales up vertically to the state and federal level. A substantial part of the chapter was spent attacking the feds and state governments: how they are present- and regulation-oriented such that 20th century Weberian ideas are propogated (specialization, process- rather than outcome-oriented), vs. how cities and regions reward innovation, drive change across different sectors of planning, etc. Overall it was very optimistic, and I definitely had to resist some eye rolls throughout.
