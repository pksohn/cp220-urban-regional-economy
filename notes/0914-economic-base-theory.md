## North vs. Tiebout

Both scholars use a region's export base to explain economic growth and development to varying degrees. 

North first refutes the "traditional" notion of regional economic growth, whereby an economy slowly matures through the stages of growth, from primary to secondary to tertiary. He then argues that the (long-term in particular) success of the export base, aided by various locational production factors, is *the* determining factor in a region's growth (using lumber in the Pacific Northwest as an example). It determines the extent of the residentiary activity supporting this primary industry, and also regional incomes, population growth and urbanization patterns, etc. He acknowledges that this export base does not need to be industrial in nature; an agricultural export base can also yield desirable residentiary outcomes.

On the other hand, Tiebout contends that there are other external factors at play in assessing regional growth. Especially for larger regions, essentially what is an export vs. an import becomes murkier, and other endogenous factors enter the picture too: "dynamic forces causing income change ... found inside its borders." Also, with internal trade within the larger regions, the relative importance of exports may decrease. Lastly, he brings up two exogenous factors that can be important determinants of a given export base: the success and prosperity of nearby regions that would be on the importing end of the export goods, and factor costs, which may vary largely from region to region. 

## Katz and Bradley

Onto Katz and Bradley. They basically championed the role of cities and regions, coming together to form a network of regional economies that defines the national economy, sort of ringing back to Jacobs' thesis. The key here is the focus on producing innovation and exporting it--it replicates horizontally across cities and also scales up vertically to the state and federal level. A substantial part of the chapter was spent attacking the feds and state governments: how they are present- and regulation-oriented such that 20th century Weberian ideas are propogated (specialization, process- rather than outcome-oriented), vs. how cities and regions reward innovation, drive change across different sectors of planning, etc. Overall it was very optimistic, and I definitely had to resist some eye rolls throughout. 

## Katz and Bradley
Criticism of the quantitative approach to economics that distorts the “noncommercial, qualitative nature” of economic well-being. Power’s argument is one that is being made today regarding data science: models are helpful and necessary, but distorting and assumption-laden. When we are perplexed and confused by complexity, the inherent distortions of economic modeling might blind us from the implications of decisions based on such.

##Overview of economic base: 
money is the object of analysis, and the only way regions can produce money is through exporting goods via trade that brings dollars in.
##Historical lens: 
French physiocrats believed that only land and labor were resources; everything else (including manufacturing) were derivative. Industrial revolution changed that. Marx et al brought manufacturing into the “productive” realm but felt that service providers, financiers, govt workers, et al were merely parasites. This view of the BASE persists; stimulating economic activity means expanding manufacturing or mining and protecting agriculture.
##Economic-base model
Crude example: 
*local firm exports $2M worth of goods. Can assume half circulates through local economy (other half may go to firm owner outside of region, external suppliers, etc).
*Then, $1M in the wallets of local actors. Assume balance of personal investments flowing out of 	and into region.
*Assume 2/3 ($667K) is spent/invested, with another 1/3 ($333K) “leaking” out of region (as before)
*Then, of $667K, 2/3 ($445K) recirculates and expands jobs etc; 1/3 ($296K) “leaks”
*Process continues until $3M of total household income has been generated.
*Income multipliers are 3 ($3M / $1M) and 1.5 ($3M / $2M); income multipler is reciprocal of fraction that “leaks” out

Implication of this model? Income multiplier and thus power of economy is based on fraction of goods imported; lower the fraction that “leaks” out to produce exports, and increase the multiplication factor. Suggests that the only income generation in an economy is through imports. In turn, you can estimate number of locally-oriented jobs created (via wage rate) by changes in export or import firms.

##Local economic development v. economic growth
In short, the sole focus on exports as growth engine ignore internal forces: population growth, age structure, changes in consumption patterns, workforce participation, etc
One good example is that the multiplier grows as a local economy becomes more self-sufficient and relies on imports less. However, the export model will attribute the multiplier growth to exports and model cannot accurately predict how long multiplier effect will take.
Empirical analyses have shown local growth to create exports more than the other way around, and service vs. non-service economies to push one another somewhat evenly.

^“…imports, not exports, are the things that are important to us. For they are the goods we enjoy directly. Sending away our ^valuable production is not an economic good in itself. It is an economic “bad,” for we lose something unless the exports allow ^us to import something even more valuable to ourselves.”

History of economic modeling corresponds with power: not how national corporations that export to “larger economy” are viewed as the base of economic growth, when in reality what is felt locally is local goods and services.
Page 124 (worth reading) discusses the policy ass-backwardsness of the economic-base model; it forces local actors to try to wrestle with things they cannot control (huge multinational export firms, for example), encouraging them not to drive the corporations away with high labor costs or environmental regulations…”don’t bite the hand that feeds”

^“The development of local dependencies is what economic development is all about.” 
(think Jacobs’ emphasis on import replacement)…
^”Service-led growth is not only possible, it is the primary mechanism of real economic development.”

Closes by talking about the softer factors of location choice – quality of life, schools, environment, etc. Puts people at the heart of economic development policy rather than businesses, necessarily

##Markusen and Schrock
M&S go one step beyond import substitution, hypothesizing that shifts in consumer preferences  may create additional demand for locally produced goods (beyond those just “replaced”)

Also, inputs in local consumption sectors may lead to jobs for people with preference for local consumption
Third, innovation in locally consumed goods may lead to new export market
Lastly, local consumption offerings bring more talented labor and entrepreneurs to the area
Theorize about three types of consumption bases:
1.	Local-serving activities
2.	Apparently local-serving activities that are mixed in orientation
3.	Distinctive activities whose significance is explained by local patronage patterns

Casinos, theater, etc can replace people’s purchase of durable goods and swap consumption habits for something that is local and service-oriented

^“selective local-serving capacity investments can capture local consumer dollars and create jobs and multiplier effects on ^their own merits, without reference to the export/import divide.” … impact “hinges on what business owners and workers … are ^doing with their incomes.”

*Also consider: Are employees spending dollars locally? (sporting events create dollar expenditures that don’t recirculate)? *Are the jobs created displacing other local dollars spent? (e.g wal-mart) – and do those profits get recirculated locally

Tremendous variation in rural vs. urban, richer vs. poorer consumption habits that affect the recirculation 
Many industries evolve by first testing out products on a local consumer base as export-replacement and then expanding. Microbreweries and Borders bookstore are examples.
Similarly, many cities are looking to enhance their quality-of-life to attract firms and people, irrespective of the “chicken-or-egg” conversation around jobs and people locating.
