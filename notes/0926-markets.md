# Lecture Notes

From last week: Why did Linhares work as a furniture manufacturing cluster? A big explanation is *collective efficiency*; the 
ability for different firms to self-organize within the cluster (term is from Schmitz).  

## Jacobs: The Economy of Cities 

The basic idea is that cities grow by adding new work to existing work.  
Famous example: Bicycles in Tokyo. Bicycles were originally imported from US, then repair economy cropped up, 
then those repair shops started to work together to manufacture parts, then entire bicycles, then differentiated offerings. 
The economy works in chains and everything is linked.  

Why do some capitals grow and some don't? If a capital city only produces government work, it's akin to a company town. 

Multiplier argument: 
* Export Multiplier: This is the Douglas North view of how economies grow. We export widgets, it brings money into the economy,
pays workers, supports suppliers, triggers local consumption by those that got paid. 
* Import-replacement Multiplier: This starts a more explosive cycle of growth that the local city has more control over. Spending less 
on bringing imports in - you have this money to spend locally (ideally to generate local import-replacing capacity).

Critiques:  
* Jacobs says "small is good" in terms of firm size; large firms are not able to innovate. Is this true? Large organizations are empirically 
just as innovative and possibly moreso than small firms.


## Markusen - Consumption Driven Development

Growth without any expansion of export base if there are regional tastes for goods and services, like arts and culture, craft beer, sports, entertainment, food.
When you have local consumption sectors, they may be more labor intensive, and create jobs that are filled by people who are more likely to spend money locally.
That whole innovation that began as a local service turns into an export sector. This in turn attracts people to come to that place. The final piece of the puzzle
is local ownership, which keeps more profits in the region.

Hospitals as an example. Service that local people are using, and providing it well, and thriving - and then exports from there. 
In New Orleans, hospital sector is an export industry to the whole region. 

Residentiary industries have been shown to have this kind of effect, like childcare. You can generate a vibrant regional economy partly out of investments in childcare.
Skilled workers really care about these services and will migrate into a region with good childcare.


## Schoenberger

Discussion of underlying assumptions of capitalism:
* Scale economies
* Profit motive
* Debt financing
* Path dependency
* Growth imperative

In the end, we may have market outcomes that don't necessarily reflect the preferences of consumers, who have constrained choices based on what is produced. 
We see each of the principles above demonstrated in the stories of the Ford Model T and sprawl in the US.
