## Definitions

**Innovation**: combining resources (products, natural resources, skills, institutions, processes, market) in unique ways to create value.
In an economic sense, you have to bring it to market for it to be a real innovation. Product innovation is common. Reorganization is an 
example of common process innovation.

**Creative Destruction**: Schumpeter argues that when you have innovation, you also have destruction. Not only can you create new value, 
but this process necessarily devalues old processes. This theory thinks of change as "lumpy" rather than gradual or incremental.

**Kondratiev waves**: Schumpeter draws on these ideas: history is organized in 50 year periods, alongside major technological innovations. 
The below years represent "troughs" that start major waves of economic activity.  

Year | Invention
---  | ---
1780 | Steam Engine
1830 | Steel and Railroads
1880 | Electricity and Chemicals
1930 | Automobiles, petrochemicals
1980 | Computing, communications technology
2010 | Nanotech (?), clean tech (?) are what were expected

Schumpeter doesn't have a lot to say about the state's role in economic growth and decline.

**Moretti and innovation hubs**: What's new here? Adds the idea of the creative class and attraction of highly-educated workers to amenities and similar people.
Moretti believes *people* drive growth of clusters, where Storper argues that this is driven by how production is structured in a given place. 
The focus is on *tradable sectors* , which is classic Douglas North, export base theory and multipliers. See Moretti's idea that tech jobs have a multiplier of 5!
If you believe this, then places like Flint, Michigan are, basically, hopeless. There's a Great Divergence, places that are ahead will continue to get ahead
 (**Disequilibrium theory**; growth poles, core-periphery, increasing returns to scale).

Criticisms - what about non-local spending that doesn't contribute to multipliers (think of Amazon)? What about innovation in non-tradable sectors like Uber?
